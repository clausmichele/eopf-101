# The Sentinels EOPF Toolkit

![](./img/logos.png)


## About
EOPF 101 is a community-driven toolkit that facilitates the adoption of the Zarr data format for Copernicus Sentinel data, targeting users who are new to cloud computing. The Sentinels EOPF Toolkit is developed by [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/), [thriveGEO](https://thrivegeo.com/) and [Sparkgeo](https://sparkgeo.com/), together with a group of champion users. Together they are creating EOPF 101, a user-friendly resource consisting of documentation, Jupyter Notebooks and plug-ins that showcase the use of Zarr format Sentinel data for applications across multiple domains.

The Sentinels EOPF Toolkit is a project funded by the [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/).

The toolkit consists of a set of community resources, including an online book, community libraries and plugins, thematic case studies and a notebook competition:

### EOPF 101 - Outline
* Chapter 1 - Introduction to EOPF
* Chapter 2 - Introduction to Zarr
* Chapter 3 - Introduction to EOPF STAC
* Chapter 4 - Tools to work with Zarr
* Chapter 5 - EOPF in Action
* Glossary
* References

### Overview of libraries and plugins
We will develop a series of open-source libraries and plugins, including the following:
* **Explore Zarr in STAC**: Pystac and QGIS usae with the EOPF STAC catalogue
* **Stackstac**
* **R with Rarr**
* **GDAL** evolution of the current driver
* **Titiler-multidimensional**: Prepare a docker for starting a titiler tailored for EOPF Zarr

### Case studies (planned)
Together with a group of champion users, we will developed and publish technical and thematic case studies that include example Jupyter Notebook workflows for using Sentinels data in Zarr format:
* `Technical case studies`:
  * Zarr with QGIS
  * Zarr with R
  * EOPF and STAC (xpystac)
  * Multi-scale Zarr
  * Dataset screening with rio-tiler and lonboard
* `Thematic case studies`:
  * Monitoring coastal dynamics in cloud-prone regions using Sentinel-1
  * African rangeland monitoring using Sentinel-2 / Sentinel-3 fusion
  * Wildfire assessment with Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2 data


### Notebook competition
Between October 2025 and January 2026, we will run a notebook competition. During this time, we will invite Sentinel data users to work with the live sample data reprocessed as part of the [EOPF Sentinel Zarr Sample Service](https://zarr.eopf.copernicus.eu/). 

Stay tuned for more information soon.


## Development timeline
By March 2026, we will have develped a community resource where you can learn how to use the EOPF Sentinel Zarr Samples Service by ESA. It is designed for Sentinel data users who are new to cloud computing.

* `June 2025`: Launch of first version during Living Planet Symposium
* `2nd half of 2025`: Development of thematic case studies together with champion users
* `Oct 2025 to Jan 2026`: EOPF Notebook competition
* `throughout`: Communications and outreach through social media and conference presence

## Get involved
We welcome to join you in this community effort in the following ways:
* Follow us here on [Github](https://github.com/eopf-toolkit)
* Participate in the upcoming notebook competition (Oct 2025 to Jan 2026) (`Stay tuned for more information soon!`)
